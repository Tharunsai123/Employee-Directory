## ðŸ’­ Reflection

### ðŸ”§ Challenges Faced

- **State Management**: Without a framework, centralizing and synchronizing state across components was complex.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the sidebar filter remained accessible and clean on small screens took several design iterations.
- **Form Validation**: Balancing thorough checks with a smooth user experience required thoughtful design.
- **Pagination Logic**: Tying together pagination with filtered and searched data was tricky.
- **Performance**: Debouncing search and minimizing DOM re-renders helped maintain speed on large datasets.
