## 💭 Reflection

### 🔧 Challenges Faced

- **State Management Without Frameworks**  
  Without tools like React or Vue, managing and syncing UI state (especially with filtering, search, and pagination) had to be carefully handled with vanilla JS.

- **Responsive Design Complexity**  
  Making sure the grid, modals, and sidebar worked across screen sizes required a well-planned CSS grid/flex layout and media queries.

- **Form Validation UX**  
  Validating multiple input types while maintaining good user experience was a non-trivial challenge.

- **Pagination With Filtering**  
  Ensuring pagination worked correctly when applying filters and searches needed extra logic to avoid inconsistencies.

### 🚀 What I’d Improve With More Time

- **🗃️ Bulk Actions**: Support selecting multiple records for batch delete or edit.  
- **🧾 CSV Export/Import**: Allow users to back up or restore employee records.  
- **🖼️ Profile Image Uploads**: Let users upload photos for employees.  
- **🌙 Dark Mode Toggle**: Use CSS custom properties to enable light/dark themes.  
- **↩️ Undo/Redo Functionality**: Revert user actions with a change history stack.  
- **🧪 Unit Testing**: Add test coverage for filtering, validation, and sorting.  
- **🔍 Accessibility**: Add ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support.  
- **📦 Modular Structure**: Split script.js into smaller reusable modules.  
- **📡 Optional API Support**: Replace local storage with server-based persistence.  
- **⚡ Performance**: Virtualize the employee list for handling large datasets.

## 🧠 Key Learnings

- Even without frameworks, solid architecture and planning make scalable apps possible.
- CSS custom properties and media queries are powerful for responsive theming.
- Pure JavaScript is fully capable of handling complex UI and UX workflows.
- Accessibility and documentation must be considered from the beginning.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- HTML5  
- CSS3 (Grid, Flexbox, Variables, Media Queries)  
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)  
- Freemarker (Optional - if dynamic template rendering is integrated)
